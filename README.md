Readerman: The Haughty Website Critic
=================

Readerman is a haughty design critic who will examine a website and then critique it to his high standards. He finds most design beneath him.

Readerman is *also* an example of agentic tool use (in this case a browser) from the Soul Engine. Readerman uses a small vision model (Firellava 13b) to support high level reasoning and has access to a pair of "robot eyes."

Readerman can agentically control a browser by visiting a url, scrolling up, or down, querying his robot eyes for visual information, or reading more deeply into an individual section.

A video of him in action is here: https://twitter.com/tobowers/status/1791072992362889412
